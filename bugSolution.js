A complete solution requires changes within the `expo-document-picker` library itself to provide more detailed error messages from the Android native code.  However, we can mitigate the issue in our application code by implementing more robust error handling.  This example tries to get more information from the error object.

```javascript
import * as DocumentPicker from 'expo-document-picker';

const pickDocument = async () => {
  try {
    const result = await DocumentPicker.getDocumentAsync();
    if (result.type === 'cancel') {
      console.log('User cancelled');
    } else if (result.uri) {
      console.log('Selected:', result.uri);
    } else {
      console.error('Error details:', JSON.stringify(result, null, 2)); // Log full error object
      // Further checks for error codes or messages from the result object could be added here
      alert('There was a problem selecting the file. Please try again.');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error picking document:', error);
    alert('An unexpected error occurred. Please try again.');
  }
};
```
This improved version logs more details about the error and provides a better user experience by alerting the user to the problem.
